the "tower-plots" are sorted top down in decreasing order of the longest IBD segment.

run-down of what should happen:
parse the IBD file for a given chromosome
sort the list s.t. the largest IBD segments come first.
take the N largest entries
load the relevant ancestries, loading them into a map Name -> Individual
traverse the list of IBD entries, for each entry:
    look up the relevant ancestries
    determine the common ancestry data
    generate some kind of Match object that is a product of the IBD entry and
    the "common ancestry object" (should I choose to write one; probably not
    necessasry).
    collect the match objects in a list
make the plot of the match objects
save the plot
exit.

A problem: we need some way of indicating if the haplotypes are phased. What I
mean is, for an individual ``I'' who is diploid, there're two haplotypes, A
and B: we need to test A_I and B_I against A_J and B_J, distributively (for a
total of four tests). If it turns out that the commonality occurs between an A
and a B, then that needs to be shown in the plot somehow, perhaps by a
different tinting or something.
