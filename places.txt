bed files
~/project/barakatt_projects/HRS/results/HRS_AFRAM_20140609/outbed

list for those individuals:
~/project/barakatt_projects/HRS/results/list_indiv/listindiv_AfrAm

It's just a list of names, and bed.py is smart enough to generate the correct filename based on the name.

their GERMLINE data, for the IBD:
~/project/baharian_projects/HRS/data/dbGaP/AfrAm/phased/3_GERMLINE

files are named like: AfrAm.chr21.IBD.match.gz

and have contents like:
161219425 161219425.0   161389621 161389621.0   21      10715343 15199847       kgp4144339 kgp22814070  128     4.48    MB      0       1       1
family    name      hap --        --        -   chr     start    end            extra data till end of line

ibd.py parses these kinds of files no problem

Now look where it says "hap". Those are the haplotypes involved in the
segment! So I only need to check for common ancestry in those haplotypes, for
those individuals.
